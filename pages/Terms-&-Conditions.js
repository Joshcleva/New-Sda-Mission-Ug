          The Sda Mission Ug app stores and processes personal data that you
          have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility
          to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
          recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
          process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
          the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
          vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
          phone’s security features and it could mean that the Sda Mission Ug
          app won’t work properly or at all.

          You should be aware that there are certain things that Josh Creative
          Programmers will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the
          app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The
          connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider,
          but Josh Creative Programmers cannot take responsibility for the app
          not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi,
          and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>{" "}
        <p></p>{" "}
        <p>
          If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
          mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In
          using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
          including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
          territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
          If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the
          app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission
          from the bill payer for using the app.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Josh Creative Programmers cannot always take
          responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure
          that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you
          can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Josh Creative Programmers
          cannot accept responsibility.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          With respect to Josh Creative Programmers’s responsibility for your
          use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in
          mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and
          correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
          information to us so that we can make it available to you. Josh
          Creative Programmers accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
          indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
          functionality of the app.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
          available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the both
          systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
          availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download
          the updates if you want to keep using the app. Josh Creative
          Programmers does not promise that it will always update the app so
          that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS
          version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise
          to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
          may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
          at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we
          tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses
          granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the
          app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
